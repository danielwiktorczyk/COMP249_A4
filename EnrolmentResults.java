/*
 * Now, you are required to write a public class called EnrolmentResults. In the
 * main() method, you must do the following: (a) Create at least two empty lists
 * from the CourseList class (needed for copy constructor III (e)); (b) Open the
 * Syllabus.txt file, and read its contents line by line. Use these records to
 * initialize one of the CourseList objects you created above. You can use the
 * addToStart() method to insert the read objects into the list. However, the
 * list should not have any duplicate records, so if the input file has
 * duplicate entries, which is the case in the file provided with the assignment
 * for instance, your code must handle this case so that each record is inserted
 * in the list only once; (c) Open a Request.txt file (prompt the user to enter
 * the name of the file that need to be processed; i.e. Request3.txt) and create
 * ArrayLists from the contents then iterate through each of the courses the
 * student wants to enroll in. Process each of the courses and print the outcome
 * whether student will be able to enroll or not. A sample output for a given
 * file is mentioned below. Again, your program should ask for the file names as
 * your program will be tested against similar input files; (d) Prompt the user
 * to enter a few courseIDs and search the list that you created from the input
 * file for these values. Make sure to display the number of iterations
 * performed; (e) Following that, you must create enough objects to test each of
 * the constructors/methods of your classes. The details of this part are left
 * as open to you. You can do whatever you wish as long as COMP249 - Winter 2018
 * Assignment 4 - Page 5 of 6 your methods are being tested including
